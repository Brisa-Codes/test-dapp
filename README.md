## Celo Composer

Celo Composer allows you to quickly build, deploy, and iterate on decentralized applications using Celo. It provides a number of frameworks, examples, and Celo specific functionality to help you get started with your next dApp.

## Built With

## Note:
Every dApp that relies on WalletConnect now needs to obtain a projectId from [WalletConnect Cloud](https://cloud.walletconnect.com/). This is absolutely free and only takes a few minutes.
